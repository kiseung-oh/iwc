                    <p>IT’S HARD TO FIND A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU WITHOUT A RADIANT SMILE. WHERE DO YOU DRAW YOUR POSITIVE ENERGY FROM?</p>
                    <p>It’s hard not to smile when you enjoy what you’re doing, but I also try to surround myself with positive people. </p>
                    <p>HOW WOULD YOUR PARENTS AND TEAM COLLEAGUES DESCRIBE YOU?</p>
                    <p>My parents would say I’m responsible and persistent. My team would say I’m hardworking and tough on myself.</p>
                    <p>DO YOU HAVE A ROUTINE BEFORE A RACE THAT HELPS YOU STAY FOCUSED?</p>
                    <p>Before a race I prioritise a good night’s sleep. It’s also important for me to disconnect and avoid overthinking. The morning of a race, I get up early, fit in some stretching and listen to some music to make sure I arrive at the track fresh.</p>

                    <p>WHEN AND HOW DID YOU DISCOVER YOUR PASSION FOR RACING CARS?</p>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember I’ve had a passion for cars and sports. In university, I was introduced to Formula 1 and started following the races, which ignited my passions further. I found myself going to track days and that’s when the dream to go racing was born.     </p>
                    <p>WHAT WAS YOUR MOM’S REACTION WHEN YOU TOLD HER YOU WANTED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL RACING CAR DRIVER?</p>
                    <p>She wasn’t surprised. I didn’t actually say I want to be a racing driver, it was more like, ‘I want to get my racing license and learn how to race’. It was a big unknown for me and my family, and we didn’t know what to expect. </p>

                    <mark>THAT IMPOSSIBLE DREAM</mark>
                    <p>YOU ARE PART OF IWC’S RAMADAN CAMPAIGN “THE GIFT OF TIME.” WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ABLE TO ENJOY A “GIFT OF TIME”?</p>
                    <p>At the end of 2022, after a tough yet successful first season in GT3s, I went back home to Jeddah and spent some much-needed quality time with friends and family and enjoyed the slow-paced life by the sea. </p>
                    <p>IN YOUR CAREER SO FAR, WHICH CHALLENGE DID YOU FIND THE HARDEST TO OVERCOME?</p>
                    <p>One of the most challenging decisions was finally taking the step to go racing. It seemed like an impossible dream. Coming into the sport late, I continue to face challenges, and as a driver I always push myself to do better and at times I have to remind myself to be patient and trust the process.</p>
                    <p>WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONVEY TO YOUNG GIRLS WHO ARE EAGER TO BECOME A RACE DRIVER LIKE YOURSELF?</p>
                    <p>Be prepared to work for your goals. </p>
                    <p>IN GENERAL?</p>
                    <p>Don’t let failure deter you. It is necessary for growth.</p>
