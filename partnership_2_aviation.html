            <p>One of the most iconic sports cars ever built, the “Gullwing” dates back to the time when IWC’s watchmakers designed the first Ingenieur. With its characteristic doors reminiscent of a seagull’s wings, it was manufactured by Daimler-Benz between 1954 and 1957 as a road ready version of the 300 SL racing car. The superb vehicle boasts 215 hp and a top speed of 250 km/h, but its attraction goes far beyond performance. Motor racing enthusiasts are very passionate about the “Gullwing”, and it perfectly embodies IWC’s core values of style, quality, originality and outstanding craftsmanship. </p>

                    <p>TOP GUN watches, which IWC has been making since 2007, take their name from the legendary Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). In this program, the US Navy trains the very best pilots in flying and tactical skills. After graduating as Strike Fighter Tactics Instructors (SFTI), the pilots return to their respective units as teachers.</p>
                    <p>To withstand the extreme strain that pilots can experience in the cockpit of supersonic jets like the F/A-18 Super Hornet or during long-lasting missions on an aircraft carrier, IWC’s TOP GUN watches are engineered using extremely robust and resilient materials such as titanium, ceramics and Ceratanium®.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, IWC created the Pilot’s Watch Chronograph Edition “Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor” (Ref. IW389004) in collaboration with instructors based on Naval Air Station Lemoore in California. Featuring a case made of black ceramic and the iconic TOPGUN patch on the dial, the rugged chronograph remains exclusively available to graduates of the Navy Fighter Weapons School.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by this military-exclusive watch, IWC launched the Pilot’s Watch Chronograph TOP GUN Edition “SFTI” (Ref. IW389104) in 2020. The all-black chronograph combines a black ceramic case with a case back and pushers made of Ceratanium®.</p>

All IWC squadron watches are available exclusively to current and former members of the respective units and feature an individual engraving of the owner’s name and call sign.
