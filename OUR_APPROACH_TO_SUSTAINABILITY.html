                        <p>Sustainability drives everything we do at IWC Schaffhausen. We have been producing watches since 1868; we’ve had over 150 years to perfect our craft, yet we continue to push ourselves. For you. For all of us. Our sustainability journey began over ten years ago, and although we don’t need, nor likely have, a century to perfect our approach, the precision, passion and persistence that go into our watchmaking will continue to drive our sustainability efforts. </p>

                        <p>We’re already thinking ahead. Beyond the here and now. Everything we produce, everything we do, everything we leave behind is guided by our purpose: ENGINEERING BEYOND TIME. We hold ourselves to a higher standard and do our part to preserve the world around us for others to enjoy.

                                    <p>Because an open and honest dialogue with all stakeholders enables us to see where we stand, where we can improve and what goals we need to set as we continue our journey.</p>

                                    <p>Whether precious metals, leather or innovative materials, we’re particular when it comes to sourcing. We openly communicate where we source our materials, how we pick our suppliers and how we hold them to account.</p>

                                    <span>THE CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE</span>
                                    <p>We donated money to Save the Children which provided, for example, shelter and food for the most disadvantaged children and also families forced to flee their homes. This support included child and adolescent friendly spaces, online psychological support and child protection services for unaccompanied and separated children.</p>

                                    <p>The Inspiration4 mission in September 2021 raised awareness and donations for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Four special edition watches created for the mission were auctioned off.</p>
