                    <p>Laureus Sport for Good was established in 2000 by Richemont and Daimler, with IWC becoming a Global Partner in 2005. The foundation brings together people who share a belief in the power of sport to break down barriers, engage with others and change the world for the better.</p>
                    <p>Laureus believes in the integrative force of sport, harnessing it to advance social change and provide better prospects for disadvantaged children and teenagers. It operates shoulder to shoulder with the Laureus World Sports Awards and the Laureus World Sports Academy. </p>

                    <p>The Academy is at the heart of Laureus, a unique association of 68 of the greatest legends from sports as diverse as football, tennis, athletics, skateboarding and motor racing. Academy Members like Edwin Moses, Tanni Grey-Thompson, Robby Naish and Martina Navratilova regularly visit the numerous projects supported by Laureus. On these occasions, young people come face-to-face with their sporting heroes. </p>
                    <p>Since Laureus Sport for Good’s inception, over six million children and teenagers have been involved in more than 250 projects worldwide in 40 countries; programmes that use sport to promote social change and end violence, discrimination, and disadvantage. Every programme Laureus supports addresses at least one of the following six social issues, which align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals: Health, Education, Women and Girls, Employability, Inclusive Society and Peaceful Society.</p>
