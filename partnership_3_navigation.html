                    <p>Solaris Yachts embodies the sportiness and elegance of sailing. Based in Aquileia, on the upper Adriatic Sea, the Italian company has been building beautiful ocean-going sailing yachts since the 1970s. Characterised by exceptional design and outstanding sailing performance, they set new standards for leisure sporting yachts. Solaris combines high-tech solutions, like carbon-fibre and glass-fibre composite materials, with traditional, solid shipbuilding. They also meet the highest interior design demands, with cabins that impress with quality craftsmanship and refined woodwork.</p>
            <p>IWC’s partnership with Solaris is founded on a shared universe of values. Both boatbuilding and mechanical watch manufacture require a high level of competence and many years of experience in various disciplines like design, engineering and craftsmanship. Furthermore, both companies design their products with a focus on first-class performance and long service life.</p>

                    <p>The history of the IWC Portugieser is inextricably linked to seafaring, sailing and navigation. In the late 1930s, watchmakers from Schaffhausen developed the first Portugieser, a wristwatch with the precision of a marine chronometer. Its clean, functional dial took inspiration from deck observation watches of the time.</p>
                    <p>In 2020, designers from IWC and Solaris Yachts joined forces to create a customised sailing yacht to bring to life the Portugieser’s backstory. A Solaris 55 from the Italian boatbuilder was designed to reflect the spirit and visual codes of the new Portugieser watch collection. The 55-foot yacht’s name “DOUBLE MOON” refers to the iconic moon-phase indication of IWC’s legendary perpetual calendar complication.</p>
                    <p>To make the universe of the Portugieser tangible in a never-before-seen way, IWC and Solaris Yachts joined forces and created a beautiful weather station. IWC continues the maritime legacy of the Portugieser and introduces a range of meteorological instruments in IWC’s classic style. The barometer, hygrometer, thermometer and clock come in the same characteristic and easy-to-read designs that are typical of the dials of many IWC watches. The Portugieser Clock & Weather Station can be bought directly through IWC boutiques in Europe and the USA. The station can also be bought via IWC.com, which offers delivery to Europe and the USA.</p>
