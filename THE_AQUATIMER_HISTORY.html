                            <p>As diving as a sport grows during the 1960s, IWC reacts to this development with the launch of its first diver’s watch, the “Aquatimer”. Its case is watertight down to a depth of 200 metres, and the rotatable bezel for adjusting the diving time is situated under the glass to prevent it being moved accidentally during the dive.</p>

                            <p>In March of 1968, the successor model, Reference 816AD/1816 was launched. Its distinctive feature were the colourful dials: a red or a blue shadow, as well as a traditional black one. It was also water resistant to 30 atmospheres.</p>

                            <p>The cooperation between Porsche and IWC lasted from 1978 until 1998 and resulted in a revolutionary new material for watchmaking: titanium. In 1982 the Porsche Design Ocean 2000 with its epoch-making design was launched. This diver’s watch could withstand high pressures down to a record depth of 2000m due to its construction and the use of titanium alloy.</p>

                            <p>The Reference 3519 is a non-magnetic watch designed for mine clearance divers. This watch needed to have a minimal magnetic field to prevent it from detonating the mines that the divers were defusing. It was therefore equipped with a special movement made from a non-magnetic material: the IWC 3755AM calibre, also known as the IWC 3755 Amag calibre.</p>

                            <p>The GST Aquatimer, Reference 3536, was a classic diving watch. With a large diameter of 42 mm, it was available in steel or titanium, with either a bracelet or a Velcro strap. It also was water resistant to a great depth of 2000 meters. In addition, it was notable for its clean, no-nonsense design and particularly, its bezel.</p>

                            <p>A very special diving watch was introduced in 1999: the Reference 3527, called the “Deep One”. It was the product of an especially clever watchmaking and engineering design. Powered by the IWC Calibre 8914, the watch included a unique complication. The Deep One had a mechanical depth gauge that showed the diver how deep he had descended. </p>

                            <p>In 2004 IWC produced a world’s first movement: the Aquatimer Minute Memory, Reference IW3723. This model has a minute rattrapante chronograph which allows elapsed time to be told in three ways: by way of the internal bezel, with the chronograph or via the patented minute fly-back hand. This is useful in determining intermediary elapsed time while diving.</p>

                            <p>In 2009 the new Aquatimer family featured increased case dimensions of 46 mm, and featured the rotating diving bezel, now located externally. A 4-mm wide sapphire crystal ring lies above a thick layer of Super-LumiNova®* luminous pigment applied in six coats, so the luminescence and legibility are optimal under all conditions of visibility. *IWC Schaffhausen is not the owner of the Super-LumiNova® trademark.</p>

                            <p>In 2014, IWC re-launched the Aquatimer. A star of the new collection was the Aquatimer Chronograph Edition “Expedition Charles Darwin”. The first watch in IWC’s history with a bronze case also featured the newly developed SafeDive system which prevents inadvertent changes of the dive time.</p>

                            <p>The Aquatimer Deep Three’s mechanical depth gauge displayed the wearer’s current depth and the maximum depth on a given dive at the same time. With this timepiece, IWC continued the tradition of mechanical depth gauge watches that was started with the GST Deep One in 1999.</p>
