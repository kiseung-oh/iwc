                        <p>Bring your IWC watch to your local IWC Boutique or authorised retail partner. After a pre-liminary assessment of the function and aesthetical condition, your client advisor will propose the suitable service and give you a pre-estimate. If you agree to the pre-estimate on the spot, we will expedite the service. Should additional work be required later we will always contact you for approval.</p>
