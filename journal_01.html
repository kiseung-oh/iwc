            <p>When you think of Miami, what comes to mind? Art deco houses, palm trees, pristine beaches, Cuban coffee… right? Now there’s one more thing to think of: ME! How come, you may ask? Well, the ‘Magic City’⁠—as Miami is affectionately called by some—served as my official launch site: the Pilot’s Watch Chronograph 41 Edition “Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One™ Team” Reference IW388108. And what occasion would be more suitable for my launch than the inaugural Miami Grand Prix™?</p>

                    <mark>FIRST OFFICIAL TEAM WATCH</mark>
                    <p>Available exclusively online on iwc.com I am the first official team watch that IWC has developed since becoming the official engineering partner of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One™ Team in 2013. Now what exactly does that mean to be the “first official team watch”? It means that not only was I developed by a joint team of design and engineering experts from IWC Schaffhausen and Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One™ but what’s even more exciting is that I was worn by members of the trackside race team in Miami including strategists aerodynamicists mechanics and race engineers. Together with them I experienced all the emotions and the nail-biting moments during the race. An experience I’ll never forget!</p>

                    <mark>THE TEAM’S SIGNATURE PETRONAS GREEN</mark>
                    <p>As for my looks I cannot hide the fact that I am extremely eye-catching. The team’s signature PETRONAS green color really is one of my main features. It’s impossible to overlook my luminescent green hands and indices which appear even starker on that jet black dial. Turn me around and you can find my name printed in PETRONAS green on my sapphire glass caseback. Also what’s particularly worth pointing out is the fact that I come with two different straps: one black calfskin-embossed strap with stitches in the iconic PETRONAS green and one green strap made entirely of rubber. And thanks to the integrated EasX-CHANGE® system you can switch and swap the straps around according to your mood and eagerness to stand out.</p>

            <h3>LIGHT, UNBREAKABLE AND STRESS-RESISTANT</h3>
            <p>Lastly, allow me to draw your attention to the material that my 41-mm-case is crafted from. Grade 5 titanium is light, rigid, skin-friendly, unbreakable, and – offering one of the highest strength-to-density ratios of any metal - stronger than pure-titanium. That’s why it is widely used in the aviation- and automotive industries – for the production of aircraft components and car parts that endure the most stress, such as engine valves. Knowing that this is the material protecting my IWC-manufactured caliber 69385 surely sets your mind at ease, doesn’t it?</p>

                    <mark>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND GREAT</mark>
                    <p>Needless to say, I’m tremendously proud to represent the amazing individuals that are the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One™ Team which currently holds the record for the most consecutive team titles with eight championships won between the 2014 and 2021 seasons. Having scored 111 wins, 232 podium finishes and 118 pole positions, among other successes, is a remarkable achievement. But it’s not just the precision and craftsmanship that makes this partnership unique. As my boss, Chris Grainger-Herr, put it: “It’s the human factor – the passion, the love and the dedication that make all the difference between good and great”. </p>
