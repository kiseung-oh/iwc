            <p>With the appointment as ECPA, read: “Environmental & Community Projects Advisor” to IWC Schaffhausen, the global environmentalist, best-selling author, philanthropist, supermodel and mother of two will be consulting IWC’s sustainability committee. Her aim: to promote biodiversity and draw particular attention to the issues faced by communities; two topics that IWC identified as crucial areas in the materiality analysis for its latest Sustainability Report 2022. The announcement of Gisele Bündchen as first-ever ECPA is accompanied by the introduction of the revolutionary MiraTex straps, a plant-based, circular and entirely plastic-free alternative to leather.</p>
            <p>Read below some excerpts from IWC’s podcast Partners in Time featuring superwoman Gisele Bündchen, IWC CEO Chris Grainger-Herr, and CMO & Chair of IWC’s Sustainability Committee, Franziska Gsell.</p>

                    <p>ON WHICH PROJECTS AND ORGANIZATIONS GISELE CHOOSES TO WORK WITH</p>
                    <p>“The ones that have a true intention and want to make a real difference by creating the biggest impact in the social and environmental area, which are the areas that I am passionate about. “Kiss the Ground” is a documentary that I produced. It talks about the whole story of soil. Everything starts with soil. If the soil is healthy, we can be healthy because we’re consuming our food from what grows in the soil. I work with organizations like that, producing documentaries to bring awareness to how people shop and become aware what’s in their food. Because we are what we eat.”</p>
                    <p>ON IWC’S NEW MIRATEX™ STRAPS</p>
                    <p>“It looks beautiful and since I’m a lover of [the question] ‘how can we do things better?’, I was fascinated to hear how you did the MiraTex™ strap. I’m very excited that this can be done. In every way, IWC is focused on making things in the most thoughtful way. It looks good, and it makes me feel good wearing it. So, that’s a win for me.”</p>

                    <p>ON HER NEW ROLE AS ENVIRONMENTAL & COMMUNITY PROJECTS ADVISOR FOR IWC</p>
                    <p>“I feel very honored to be part of this team, because that’s how we create the biggest impact: through collaboration, right? That’s why I love that you have the Sustainability Report. Because it really shows how you’re having an impact in a practical way. To think about what we are producing, and how, in the most thoughtful and responsible way.</p>
                    <p>If you have a watch that can last forever and can be passed on from father to son… What a beautiful thing! It has a history. It has a sentiment that is more important than anything that you can just buy and replace with somethinew. It becomes this beautiful energy that is in this piece.</p>
                    <p>I was very excited to come in and learn about everything that IWC is doing in terms of sustainability and community because one is not separate from the other. We are nature. And when nature is in equilibrium, our lives will be, to</p>
