                <h2>VISIT THE IWC MANUFAKTURZENTRUM 
                    <p>A visit to the IWC Manufakturzentrum is an exciting and unforgettable experience - whether you are a long-time enthusiast or a novice to the world of watches. On our virtual or in-person tours, you will learn about the elaborate engineering and sophisticated craftsmanship that goes into every timepiece from Schaffhausen. Our recently expanded virtual tour brings you closer to the watchmakers and engineers than ever before.</p>

                <p>The Manufakturzentrum was inaugurated in 2018 to mark the 150th anniversary of IWC. In this highly flexible 14,000 square meters facility, we have successfully consolidated movement parts making, movement assembly and case making. Combining traditional craftsmanship with state-of-the-art production processes and technology, we are crafting timepieces that are as precise and reliable as they are aesthetically beautiful. With its transparent layout and architecture inspired by modernist exhibition pavilions, the Manufakturzentrum offers a unique visitor experience – whether you visit us virtually or in person.</p>

Accompanied by an experienced ambassador, you will first explore IWC’s rich history in our museum. Afterwards, you will head to the Manufakturzentrum and take an interactive deep dive into the manufacturing process of our iconic timepieces, visiting more departments than we can show you if you visit virtually. Back in Schaffhausen, we will guide you around our watchmaking ateliers before finishing off the tour with an exclusive touch & feel of our iconic watch collections. </p>

                    <p>During this entertaining and informative 1-hour experience, you will closely follow the creation of our biggest icons.
