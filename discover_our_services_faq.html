                                <span>Why should I have my timepiece serviced?</span>
                                <p>Your timepiece is a high-precision instrument and the greatest care has been taken in its design and production. Composed of numerous components, oils, and lubricants, it deserves the greatest attention to ensure that it continues to work perfectly for many years to come.</p>

                                <span>How often should my watch be serviced?</span>
                                <p>The optimal service cycle for your IWC timepiece is exclusive to your watch and unique lifestyle. The necessary interval between services will be determined by your individual wearing habits – such as the frequency of wear, the environment(s) you live in and the intensity of physical activity you engage in.</p>
                                <p>Your watch is a finely tuned mechanical instrument. The more carefully you handle your watch, the longer it will continue to function flawlessly. We simply recommend that you continue wearing your watch for as long as you please and to only entrust it for a service if you notice a deviation from the regular performance, function or timekeeping. In this case, we will be happy to return your watch to its original performance level as part of servicing.</p>

                                <span>How often should the water resistance of my watch be checked?</span>
                                <p>The water-resistance of a watch is not a permanent characteristic. Seals and sealing systems in particular are subject to wear and tear and natural ageing. External influences such as cosmetics, salt water, and/or impacts to the case can fundamentally affect the water-resistance. After use in or under water, your watch should be rinsed off with clear fresh water and then dried. The water-resistance should be tested at least once a year.</p>

                                <span>What can I do, if my timepiece requires a service?</span>
                                <p>You may submit your timepiece for service via one of the following channels:</p>

                                <p>It is not possible to send your timepiece directly to the Manufacture for servicing. The Manufacture in Schaffhausen cannot process service orders sent in by customers. All timepieces requiring service at the Manufacture must be submitted by regular process via your local IWC Boutique, authorised retailer or our complimentary shipping kit service.</p>

                                <p>IWC Schaffhausen grants a 24-month warranty on all work carried out and parts replaced as part of the Complete and Restoration services, and a 12-month warranty for a Simple service.</p>
                                <p>The IWC Service Guarantee applies to IWC watches serviced by an authorised IWC Boutique, or service centre.</p>

                                <p>You can use our Service Price Calculator to generate a pre-estimate for service. Have your serial number or model reference handy to retrieve the service and part prices for your timepiece.</p>

                                <span>How long does it take to have your products serviced?</span>
                                <p>The time required for a service is approximately 4 weeks, dependant on the service needed. As each service request is considered independently, a more precise indication of the expected leadtime for the service of your watch will be offered following the diagnosis by our expert watchmakers. Please note that the average service time required for a Vintage timepiece is approximately 8 weeks. Servicing of Vintage timepieces must be done by Heritage specialist watchmakers at our Manufacture in Schaffhausen. Therefore, please consider there is also additional time required for the transfer of the watch to and from Switzerland.</p>

                                <span>What are the steps to service my timepiece?</span>
                                <p>A specialist watchmaker performs a thorough analysis of your timepiece and prepares a cost estimate for the necessary works. If you have already approved the scope of service and the costs in advance, your timepiece will be serviced without delay. You can find a detailed explanation of our service procedure here.</p>

                                <p>When submitting your timepiece for service you will be presented with a pre-estimate for the expected service cost. If you approve these costs on the spot, your timepiece will be put straight into service following diagnosis. Should the outcome of the diagnosis foresee an amount higher than the pre-estimate value, you will receive a revised cost estimate for consideration. To expedite the service, please approve the cost estimate with your Boutique, authorised retailer or Concierge, without delay.</p>

                                <span>How can I confirm the authenticity of my timepiece and what are the expenses?</span>
                                <p>A thorough examination performed by one of our specialist watchmakers in Schaffhausen can either confirm or refute the authenticity of your timepiece.

                                <p>The information on the certificate mainly relates to the reference, case and movement. The certificate may also include information about other special features.

                                <span>What is the average life cycle of a leather bracelet?</span>
                                <p>If you enjoy wearing your timepiece on a daily basis, the average life span of a leather strap is between 12-18 months. It is necessary to take note that as a natural, porous material the leather, glue and stitching are adversely affected in particular by moisture absorption. Preventing the leather from frequent or prolonged exposure to lotions, water and/or excessive humidity may avoid your leather strap wearing out faster than expected. For hygienic reasons, we recommend to exchange your leather strap regularly.</p>

                                <span>What does the water resistance of my watch equate to?</span>
                                <p>The water-resistance of IWC watches is stated in bar and not in metres. Metres, which are often used elsewhere in the watch industry to indicate water-resistance, cannot be equated with the dive depth because of the test procedures that are frequently used. The following are some examples for explanation: an IWC watch with an indicated water-resistance of 1 bar is protected against splashing water. With water-resistance of 3 to 5 bar, the watch can be worn when swimming or skiing, and at 6 to 12 bar it will have no problem with water sports or snorkeling. Diver’s watches with an indicated water-resistance as of 12 bar are professional measuring instruments designed for scuba-diving. Special diver’s watches resistant to 100 bar or 200 bar are suitable even for deep-sea diving.</p>

                                <p>Your timepiece is a high-precision instrument and the greatest care has been taken in its design and production. Composed of numerous components, oils, and lubricants, it deserves the greatest attention to ensure that it continues to work perfectly for many years to come.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>How often should my watch be serviced?</span>
                                <p>The optimal service cycle for your IWC timepiece is exclusive to your watch and unique lifestyle. The necessary interval between services will be determined by your individual wearing habits – such as the frequency of wear, the environment(s) you live in and the intensity of physical activity you engage in.</p>
                                <p>Your watch is a finely tuned mechanical instrument. The more carefully you handle your watch, the longer it will continue to function flawlessly. We simply recommend that you continue wearing your watch for as long as you please and to only entrust it for a service if you notice a deviation from the regular performance, function or timekeeping. In this case, we will be happy to return your watch to its original performance level as part of servicing.</p>

                                <span>How often should the water resistance of my watch be checked?</span>
                                <p>The water-resistance of a watch is not a permanent characteristic. Seals and sealing systems in particular are subject to wear and tear and natural ageing. External influences such as cosmetics, salt water, and/or impacts to the case can fundamentally affect the water-resistance. After use in or under water, your watch should be rinsed off with clear fresh water and then dried. The water-resistance should be tested at least once a year.</p>

                                <p>You can use our Service Price Calculator to generate a pre-estimate for service. Have your serial number or model reference handy to retrieve the service and part prices for your timepiece.</p>

                                <p>The time required for a service is approximately 4 weeks, dependant on the service needed. As each service request is considered independently, a more precise indication of the expected leadtime for the service of your watch will be offered following the diagnosis by our expert watchmakers. Please note that the average service time required for a Vintage timepiece is approximately 8 weeks. Servicing of Vintage timepieces must be done by Heritage specialist watchmakers at our Manufacture in Schaffhausen. Therefore, please consider there is also additional time required for the transfer of the watch to and from Switzerland.</p>

                                <p>Only the Manufacturer may present you with an official IWC Certificate of Authenticity.

                                <span>What is the average life cycle of a leather bracelet?</span>
                                <p>If you enjoy wearing your timepiece on a daily basis, the average life span of a leather strap is between 12-18 months. It is necessary to take note that as a natural, porous material the leather, glue and stitching are adversely affected in particular by moisture absorption. Preventing the leather from frequent or prolonged exposure to lotions, water and/or excessive humidity may avoid your leather strap wearing out faster than expected. For hygienic reasons, we recommend to exchange your leather strap regularly.</p>

                                <p>The water-resistance of IWC watches is stated in bar and not in metres. Metres, which are often used elsewhere in the watch industry to indicate water-resistance, cannot be equated with the dive depth because of the test procedures that are frequently used. The following are some examples for explanation: an IWC watch with an indicated water-resistance of 1 bar is protected against splashing water. With water-resistance of 3 to 5 bar, the watch can be worn when swimming or skiing, and at 6 to 12 bar it will have no problem with water sports or snorkeling. Diver’s watches with an indicated water-resistance as of 12 bar are professional measuring instruments designed for scuba-diving. Special diver’s watches resistant to 100 bar or 200 bar are suitable even for deep-sea diving.</p>
