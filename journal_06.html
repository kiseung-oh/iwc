                <h2>EILEEN GU - THE HIGH-FLYER</h2>
                <p>THE JOURNAL SPOKE WITH FREESTYLE SKIER AND 2022 WINTER OLYMPICS GOLD-MEDAL FAVOURITE, IWC BRAND AMBASSADOR EILEEN GU</p>

            <p>It is hard to pin down Eileen Gu. If you had asked the eighteen-year-old last year what’s next for her, she probably would have said, “Being a food connoisseur”. She loves food, she really does. But right now, the freestyle skier, multiple gold medallist, accomplished runner, and high-end fashion model would admit that she is really into particle physics (more about her favourite place to indulge in physics in question 8). There’s a lot going on in Eileen’s brain, and of the 100 projects she tackles, she excels in at least 99.</p>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>To make Eileen’s list of accomplishments short: She was the first person, regardless of gender, to win two gold medals at the same world cup in 2020; the first female rookie to win three medals at her debut X Games; the first person to ever win three medals at World Championships; and the first person of Chinese descent to ever win the X Games, doubling China’s medal count. Eileen is also a gold-medal favourite at the 2022 Winter Olympics and one of the few female freeskiers in the world who competes in both halfpipe and slopestyle.</p>
                    <p>The JOURNAL spoke with the smart, hardworking and likable athlete who (with an SAT score of an incredible 1580) was admitted to study at Stanford University as of summer 2022. </p>
                    <p>WHAT DOES YOUR CHINESE NAME “谷愛凌” MEAN?</p>
                    <p>The first part of Eileen (愛) means “love”, and the second part means cloud. My whole family has very nature-oriented names. My mom’s first name means swallow bird, my uncle’s name means ocean. My mom and I are especially connected because we’re both flying in the sky. It’s a very free conceptual thing.</p>

                    <mark>THAT COMPETITIVE SPIRIT</mark>
                    <p>WHAT ROLE HAVE YOUR PARENTS PLAYED IN YOUR LIFE?</p>
                    <p>For every kid, their parents or caretakers are the biggest influencers and shapers into their morals, values and work ethic. And that’s no different from me. My grandma is a big dreamer and very, very competitive, so I think that she instilled in me that competitive spirit. My mom is much more the pragmatic mind and gave me the tools and the work ethic. So, I think I have a good combination of both of those. </p>
                    <p>HOW DO YOU GET IN THE ZONE BEFORE A TOURNAMENT? DO YOU HAVE ANY RITUALS?</p>
                    <p>I am very superstitious, so before I compete, I do my track warm-up, so A-skips, B-skips, C-skips… (I’m in ski boots, so it looks kind of dumb). I do everything in sets of eight because eight people make finals. Then, I put my poles down: one pole has to be up, one pole has to be down. And when I drop into the half-pipe, I’ll tap my poles two times behind me, hands two times, thighs and shoulders two times, head two times. So, it’s like tap tap - tap tap - tap tap - tap tap. I’ve looked into psychology and it says that superstition is really good for competition and that it creates mentally stronger athletes.</p>
