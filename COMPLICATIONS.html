            <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/compilation_1_ANNUAL_CALENDAR.png" data-title="ANNUAL CALENDAR" data-text="On the annual calendar, the month, date and day are displayed in three separate windows arranged according to the American date format. The complication automatically takes into account the differing lengths of individual months. In contrast to the perpetual calendar, the date on this model needs to be advanced manually via the crown once a year at the end of February. Two barrels provide enough torque to drive the three display discs. Overall, it took IWC’s watch designers 5 years to develop the annual calendar.">

            <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/compilation_2_PERPETUAL_CALENDAR.png" data-title="PERPETUAL CALENDAR" data-text="In the early 1980s, IWC’s head-watchmaker Kurt Klaus set out on an engineering journey to translate the Gregorian calendar with its many irregularities into a mechanical program for a wristwatch. His ingenious perpetual calendar, which debuted in the Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar in 1985, comprises only about 80 parts and displays the date, day, month, year in four digits, and the moon phase. The smart mechanical program automatically recognises the different length of the months, and even adds a leap day at the end of February every four years. The moon phase display is so precise that it will deviate from the actual phase of the moon by just one day after 577.5 years. All displays are perfectly synchronised and can be adjusted simply by turning the crown. Some models come with an additional century slide, so the watch can continue showing the date until 2499. The calendar only needs a small adjustment in those centurial years that skip the leap year, which is the case in 2100, 2200, and 2300. Some versions of the calendar feature a double moon phase display, showing the moon phase on the northern and southern hemispheres.">

            <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/compilation_3_CONSTANT-FORCE_TOURBILLON.png" data-title="CONSTANT-FORCE TOURBILLON" data-text="IWC integrated a patented constant-force mechanism into a tourbillon, which ensures that the amplitude of the balance – and thus the watch’s accuracy – remain absolutely constant, initially by disconnecting the escapement from the direct flow of energy generated by the gear train. The energy is stored temporarily in a balance spring and dispensed to the escape wheel. In the process, the tension in the spring is increased once a second and the seconds hand in the tourbillon advances in one-second steps. This ensures an extremely regular and precise rate over a period of at least 48 hours. After approximately 2 days, the mechanism switches from constant-force mode to normal mode, as indicated by the one-fifth-of-a-second movements in the seconds hand.">

            <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/compilation_4_TOURBILLON.png" data-title="TOURBILLON" data-text="The tourbillon was originally designed to offset the gravitational error in pocket watches; today it mainly serves an aesthetic function. For the tourbillon, the balance, pallet and escape wheel are mounted in a tiny cage that rotates around its own axis once every minute. The construction of this mechanism represents an enormous challenge, and results in a filigree work of art consisting of 82 parts and weighing less than 0.5 grams. Only the most experienced master watchmakers are entrusted with the task of creating these works of art and are responsible for them from start to finish.">

The split-seconds hand, which runs underneath the stopwatch hand, can be stopped independently using a push-button at “10 o’clock”, while the stopwatch hand continues to run. This allows the user to record two separate times, precisely to the second, within any given minute. If the third push-button is pushed again, the split-seconds hand instantaneously catches up and is synchronized with the stopwatch hand. It is then possible to record a new intermediate time.">

The highly complex strike train is operated by an eye-catching repeating slide and chimes out the time in crystal-clear tones: the hours on the lower-pitched of the two gongs, followed by a double strike on both gongs for the quarters and finally a single strike on the higher-pitched gong for the minutes. Each gong is individually handmade and then carefully tuned for pitch and tonal purity. The all-or-nothing-piece slide, as it is known, ensures that the mechanism will never chime out an incomplete – and thus incorrect – series of acoustic tones even if the repeating slide is released too early.">

Rather than being housed in a cage, the escapement is mounted and turns on a bearing on one side only. It is set against a deep black background, creating the illusion that the complex mechanism is floating in the dial. The tourbillon rotates around its own axis once every 60 seconds to counteract the pull of gravity on any disequilibrium in the balance wheel that would adversely affect the watch’s rate and accuracy.">

The precise interplay of 659 individual mechanical parts and years of experience in the art of watchmaking make it possible to fit so many different complications in such a small space. Apart from the chronograph functions, a perpetual calendar with displays for the date, day, month, year, decade and century as well as a perpetual moon phase, mechanically programmed until 2499, are included. Rounding it off is the supreme achievement in the art of mechanical watchmaking: the minute repeater.">

The bezel is pushed down on opposing sides with the thumb and forefinger. The desired time zone (or, during the daylight saving time, the small “S” just before the city name) is then turned to the “12 o’clock” position. The movement of the bezel is transferred to the hour wheel, 24-hour display and date advance wheel, ensuring that all three displays can be adjusted forwards or backwards in one-hour steps. Drive for the normal movement of the hour hand and its “jump” when the time zone is changed is provided via a differential gear.">

After 31 days have passed, the spring is no longer under tension and allows the date hand to jump back to “one”. In months with fewer than 31 days or when the watch has not been used for a while, the date display can be advanced rapidly using the crown. This does not involve resetting the time.">

The classic moon phase mechanism is rounded to 29.5 days. However, setting a mechanical gear train to half days is not the simplest of tasks. This is why the simpler version of the moon phase display uses a gear train with 59 teeth for two sets of 29.5 days. In the 50000-calibre family, first unveiled in 2015, larger moon phase wheels with a higher number of teeth reduce the deviation so drastically that a future inheritor of the watch would theoretically need to take it to a watchmaker to have the moon phase display adjusted by only 1 day in 577.5 years.">

The date advance wheel for the single-digit and tens discs advances daily. However, the quick-action switch siphons off a little energy every night when the date display moves forward. It stores this energy and then discharges it precisely at the end of the month or year when, in addition to the date and month disc, the leap year disc also needs to be advanced. The digital display dates back to the IWC Pallweber watches from 1884 that displayed the hours and minutes using digits.">

Through the pressure converter, water pressure acts on a spring membrane and pushes a shaft towards the interior of the case. This movement is transmitted through a system of levers and moves the gauge’s two indicators at the centre of the watch. While the blue current depth indicator moves to show current dive depth, the red maximum depth indicator remains at the maximum depth attained in the course of the dive, prevented by a pawl from returning to its original position. The maximum depth indicator can be reset to zero by pressing a push-button.">

Until now, for IWC tourbillon watches, pulling out the crown would stop the hour and minute hands, but the gear train would continue to run. Now, the balance, and thus the entire gear train including all hands, is also stopped. When the crown is pulled out, the mechanism is stopped by two levers that grip the balance rim like a set of pliers.">

            <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/compilation_17_TIDE_INDICATION.png" data-title="TIDE INDICATION" data-text="The tides are a timelessly fascinating spectacle: twice a day, the waves retreat from the shore before inexorably rising again. This natural phenomenon is caused by a complex interplay between the gravitational and centrifugal forces of the moon, the earth and the sun. The time between two high tides is precisely 12 hours and 24 minutes. If, for example, it is high tide at midnight, the next high tide will occur at 12.24. The Portugieser Yacht Club Moon & Tide shows the slightly shifting time for the next high tide on the dial. During the 12 hours and 24 minutes between two high tides, the display disc will rotate by around 24 minutes on its 12-hour scale. The energy required is channelled from the base movement’s hour pinion. A precisely calculated reducing gear comprising three cogs slows the rotation to the point where the tidal disc rotates around its axis once in exactly 14.76 days. The tidal display module is integrated into the 82835 calibre movement and contains 49 parts.">
