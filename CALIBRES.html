For these rugged and reliable movements, and for the first time ever, IWC has used components made of silicon. The escape wheel and pallet lever are made of this incredibly wear-resistant material. A bidirectional pawl-winding system supplies the energy required by the movement. Similarly to a Pellaton automatic winding system, it winds the mainspring when the rotor is moving in either direction. Thanks to advances in movement technology, the 32000-calibre family offers a 72-hour to 120-hour power reserve. In addition, the long service life of the mechanical components has been increased by newly developed lubricants.">

Just 1,960 complete revolutions of the rotor winds the movement for a full 7 days. They also use the best ideas generated during the development of the bidirectional Pellaton pawl-winding system, such as the spring-mounted rotor and balance with a Breguet spring for maximum precision. In-house movements from the 50000-calibre family are used in complications such as the perpetual calendar, the moon phase module and the tourbillon.">

Two barrels provide an impressive 7 days’ power reserve. The winding pawls and the automatic wheel are made of black ceramic while the rotor bearing is made of white ceramic. These extremely hard high-tech materials make the automatic winding system practically wear-free. The indexless balance with a frequency of 4 hertz (28,800 beats per hour) and the Breguet spring guarantee maximum precision. The design and finish of the movement was also considerably enhanced. The proportions of the rotor and the inset “Probus Scafusia” gold medallion are noticeably slimmer.">

The extra day in reserve ensures that the movement maintains as constant a driving torque as possible and continues to run precisely. The movement is stopped mechanically before the reduced torque can cause it to start running inaccurately. This also means that the owner can safely wind the watch once a week. The indexless balance has a frequency of 4 hertz (28,800 beats per hour) and, together with the Breguet spring bent into shape in accordance with age-old watchmaking tradition, helps to make the watch exceptionally accurate.">

The chronograph is a classic column-wheel design and takes the energy it needs from a bidirectional pawl-winding system similar to the Pellaton mechanism. The dial contains three subdials: one for the hour counter at “9 o’clock”, one for the minute counter at “12 o’clock” and one for the small seconds at “6 o’clock”. Movements in this calibre family have a frequency of 4 hertz (28,800 beats per hour) and a power reserve of 46 hours.">

It is fitted with the highly efficient IWC Pellaton automatic winding system, which uses both directions of the rotor to wind the mainspring. As in the IWC-manufactured 52000 calibre family, components in the system subject to pronounced stress, such as the pawls, the automatic wheel, or the cam, are made of ceramic. Thanks to the use of this high-tech material, they are virtually wear-free. The efficient automatic winding system builds up a power reserve of at least 60 hours in the mainspring. The indexless balance with a flat coil oscillates at a frequency of 4 hertz (28,800 beats per hour), ensuring a high level of precision. The rotor is skeletonised and offers a view of the movement decorated with circular graining and Geneva stripes.">

In this movement, the hours and minutes are combined in a totalizer at 12 o’clock. This makes it just as easy to read a stop time of 8 hours and 54 minutes as it is to check the current time. The 89365 version features the stop minutes and seconds function as well as a flyback function. Further developments to the 89800 calibre eventually involved incorporating the big digital date and month display as used, for example, in the Portugieser Perpetual Calendar Digital Date-Month. Other complications can also be found in the 89630 calibre with perpetual calendar and the 89900 with tourbillon. This can be adjusted to the second thanks to a stop mechanism.">

The 94800-calibre version provides higher torque to drive the constant-force tourbillon and additionally, powers the moon phase and the power reserve displays. In the 94900 version, it provides the power needed for the astronomical module in the Portugieser Sidérale Scafusia. This extravagant timepiece features displays for sidereal and solar time, the times of sunrise and sunset, and shows the section of the night sky currently visible. In the 94200 calibre, the second barrel powers the separate wheeltrain for the discs of the digital Pallweber display for the hours and minutes.">

Since it is so ideally suited for large hand-wound wristwatches, it is very closely associated with the story of the Portugieser family. One of the highlights in the calibre family’s history was the 9828 calibre from 1993, which featured a balance with shock-resistance. The 98290 calibre used from 2005 onwards combines tradition and technological progress by using both the elongated index (the “F. A. Jones arrow”), which facilitates quick, easy adjustment of the spring length, and a modern shock-absorption system. Movements from the 98000-calibre family are also found in models featuring a minute repeater and tourbillon.">
