            <p>His Instagram photos of majestic peaks and landscapes captivate thousands. During a recent city run, Swiss photographer and Rapperswil-native, Joni Hedinger, discovered and captured Schaffhausen, the birthplace of IWC watches. Filled with stunning sights, his route promises an unforgettable experience. It begins at the Rhine Falls, passes by the IWC Schaffhausen headquarters, includes a climb up to a 16th century fortress alongside vineyards, and concludes in a Schaffhausen countryside poppy field.</p>

                    <p>Starting at the Rhine Falls, I felt quite small as I took in the breathtaking view of Europe’s largest waterfall. The power of the cascading water set the tone for my run. On my wrist, I wore the IWC Pilot’s Watch Chronograph 41 TOP GUN (Ref. IW389401) with stop function. The first part of my route led me along the Rhine.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before reaching the old town of Schaffhausen, I passed the IWC headquarters. I couldn’t help but appreciate its architectural significance and the city’s watchmaking heritage. After a quick look at the beautiful building, which also houses the IWC Museum, I continued my run.</p>

                    <p>Taking a moment for a coffee break was a welcome pause during my run. I found a cozy café where I enjoyed an espresso which provided me with new energy.</p>
                    <p>The old town of Schaffhausen is clearly worth a visit. I passed many historic buildings. Of course, it also offers many different stores and restaurants which I did not have time to visit during my run.</p>
                    <p>After the break, I resumed the stop function on my Pilot’s Watch Chronograph 41 TOP GUN and continued on.</p>

                    <p>I made my way to the Munot, a historic fortress that offered panoramic views of the city. After running up the 200-meter long staircase and reaching the summit, I stepped inside the Munot and was immediately captivated by its historic charm. The fortress exuded a sense of timelessness, and I was transported back in time, imagining the stories and events that had taken place within its walls.</p>
                    <p>On the top of Munot, looking out over the city of Schaffhausen, I saw a patchwork of rooftops and the sparkling waters of the Rhine river. It was a sight that made every effort worthwhile. I took a moment to catch my breath and enjoy the view that stretched out before me.</p>
                    <p>The Munot was a true highlight of the city run, offering not only physical exertion but also a glimpse into the historical heritage of Schaffhausen.</p>

                    <p>The final part of my run through Schaffhausen took me to the calm rural region surrounding the city. As I ventured away from the bustling streets and into the peaceful countryside, a whole new world unfolded before me. The countryside of Schaffhausen was a scenic escape from the urban environment.</p>
                    <p>One particular highlight was a poppy field. As I arrived at this serene location, I was struck by its charm. It was a reminder to slow down, to breathe, and to find joy in the simplicity of the natural world.</p>
                    <p>That was the end of my run. I would say a perfect finish.</p>
