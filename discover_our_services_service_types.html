                                <p>An IWC diagnosis watchmaker assesses the technical functionality of the movement and any complications and checks the aesthetical conditions of the case and bracelet.

                                <p>After extracting the movement, we dismantle the case and clean all parts in an ultrasonic bath. Our Complete Service also includes polishing the case and metal bracelet. Significant irregularities or deep traces of wear may be removed using laser welding.

The watchmaker then carefully inspects the condition of each component and replaces any wearing part that no longer meets our standards.

                                <p>After overhauling and reassembling the movement, the dial and the hands are mounted onto the movement. We then carefully refit the mechanism into the refurbished case.

                        <p>Restoring a vintage timepiece is a complex task that requires a great wealth of training, experience, and manual skills, many of which have become extremely rare. The goal of restoration is always to preserve the watch in its original condition. This applies to the technical aspects, such as the movement and complications, and aesthetics like the visual appearance of the case, dial, and hands. Every project starts with a comprehensive diagnosis and assessment of your watch by our vintage watchmakers. They then prepare a detailed cost estimate, considering your requirements and requests. Due to the enormous complexity involved, restoration can take anywhere from several months to more than a year.</p>
                        <p>During restoration, the case, dial, and hands are carefully refurbished to meet the original criteria from the time the watch was crafted. Many timepieces have been handed down through generations and hold a high emotional value for their owners.

Because dials are often oxidized, their refurbishment calls for many individual and complex working steps.

In these cases, we replace the parts in question with original spare parts from the respective period.
