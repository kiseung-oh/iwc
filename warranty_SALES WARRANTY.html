        <h2>INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The following International Limited Warranty applies to IWC watches purchased in the original labelled container/box in any country (including the United States of America, Canada and Australia) and presented for warranty service in the same or any other country.</p>
            <span>-</span>
            <h3>WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY COVERS AND FOR HOW LONG</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Your watch has been made according to the strict quality standards of IWC and with all the care of highly qualified watchmakers. The watch is covered by this International Limited Warranty against defects in manufacturing and materials. Please contact one of the authorized IWC boutiques, IWC retailers or IWC service centres located around the world (service contacts can be found at www.iwc.com/stores) and they will be able to provide warranty service as defined herein.</p>
                <p>IWC warrants its product against defects in materials and manufacturing for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of purchase stated on your original invoice and/or the warranty booklet (the “Warranty Period”). If the product is returned during the Warranty Period, IWC will repair or replace any defective watch or part free of charge within a reasonable time after the product is returned, subject to the exclusions mentioned hereunder and to the right to charge for shipping costs. Upon expiration of the Warranty Period, any repairs will be subject to a service charge.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>HOW TO OBTAIN SERVICE</h3>
            <div>
                <p>You may obtain service by bringing or sending the watch in the original labelled container/box to your authorized IWC boutique, IWC retailer or to any IWC service centre. You may be responsible for transportation costs, including, but not limited to, postage, insurance and packing materials. We recommend that any shipments to us include certified delivery and insurance.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain service through this International Limited Warranty, the returned watch must be accompanied by the original International Limited Warranty card/certificate that was included with the watch in the container/box at the time of purchase, duly completed, dated, stamped and signed by an authorized IWC boutique or IWC retailer. This International Limited Warranty card/certificate may only be completed by an authorized IWC boutique or IWC retailer. </p>

            <div>
                <h4>LIMITED WARRANTY</h4>
                <div>

NEITHER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY NOR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SHALL EXTEND BEYOND THE PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR (24) MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR (24) MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, IWC WILL, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, REPAIR OR REPLACE ANY DEFECTIVE WATCH OR PART UNDER THE LIMITED WARRANTY FREE OF CHARGE SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT TO CHARGE FOR SHIPPING COSTS, AND SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:</p>

                <h4>MANDATORY STATUTORY RIGHTS</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.</p>
                    <p>The Mandatory Statutory Rights apply only to watches purchased in Australia and presented for guarantee services in Australia. If you seek to rely on your Mandatory Statutory Rights under the Australian Consumer Law in relation to a defect in goods supplied, you may be entitled to recover any reasonably foreseeable loss or damage that results from the defect. This may include the costs associated with transporting the watch to Richemont Australia Pty. Ltd. or an authorized IWC boutique, IWC retailer or IWC service centre. The International Limited Warranty gives you further benefits, which are in addition to your rights and remedies under the Australian Consumer Law and any other laws in relation to the goods. Subject to your Mandatory Statutory Rights under the Australian Consumer Law, IWC warrants its product against defects in materials and manufacturing for the Warranty Period. If the product is returned during the Warranty Period, IWC will, at its sole discretion, repair or replace any defective watch or part free of charge within a reasonable time after the product is returned, subject to the exclusions mentioned in “What is not covered under the International Limited Warranty” here above. Upon expiration of the Warranty Period, any repairs will be subject to a service charge.</p>
                    <p>Subject to your Mandatory Statutory Rights under the Australian Consumer Law, if you make a claim under this International Limited Warranty (instead of your Mandatory Statutory Rights) you may be responsible for transportation costs, including but not limited to postage, insurance and packing materials. We recommend that any shipment to us include certified delivery and insurance.</p>
