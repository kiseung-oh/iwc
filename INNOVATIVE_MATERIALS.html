                    <span>TITANIUM</span>
                    <div>
                        <p>Titanium is light and unbreakable. Additionally, the material is exceptionally skin-friendly and has an attractive matte-grey sheen.</p>
                        <p>When a material needs to combine toughness with resilience, but still needs to be light, titanium is the best choice. The metal is enormously rugged and weighs about a third less than steel. Because of its skin-friendliness and anti-allergic properties, it is also used, among other things, for medical implants. All these properties virtually predestine titanium for use in watch cases. The challenge, however, is that the material is unusually hard and therefore difficult to machine. After every stage in the process, it needs to be soft-annealed or cooled down. In 1980, IWC unveiled the world’s first titanium wristwatch: IWC Porsche Design Titanchronograph (Ref. 3700). The engineers from Schaffhausen had acquired the expertise needed for its manufacture by liaising closely with experts from the French aviation and aerospace company Aérospatial. Since then, titanium watches have remained a fixed part of the portfolio, especially as members of the Pilot’s Watch and Ingenieur families.</p>

                    <span>CERATANIUM®</span>
                    <div>
                        <p>As light and robust as titanium but at the same time similarly hard and scratch-resistant as ceramic: the Ceratanium® developed by IWC makes it possible for the first time to produce a completely black watch without any form of coating.</p>
                        <p>The latest innovative material from Schaffhausen is Ceratanium® (ceramized titanium). The new material is as tough and almost as light as titanium but at the same time similarly hard and scratch-resistant as ceramic. Ceratanium® is based on a special titanium alloy that is made specifically for IWC. All the components in the case are milled, turned and drilled from the blank. It then goes into the oven for a thermal treatment. During this process, a phase transformation takes place, and the surface of the metal is ceramized. The process gives it not only the properties akin to ceramics, such as extreme hardness, but also its striking, matte black colour. For the first time, Ceratanium® makes it possible to manufacture components such as push-buttons or the pin buckle in a jet black design without coating.</p>

                    <span>BRONZE</span>
                    <div>
                        <p>Thanks to its specific composition, the bronze alloy used by IWC is just as hard as stainless steel and particularly skin-friendly.</p>
                        <p>Bronze is one of the oldest materials in the history of humankind. Its use in the production of items of cultural significance is documented back to the middle of the fourth millennium BCE. Bronze is a catch-all metallurgical term used to describe alloys with a copper content of at least 60 per cent. For its watch cases, IWC uses aluminium bronze, which along with copper also contains aluminium and iron. This specific composition makes the alloy around 50 per cent harder than standard bronze and approximately as hard as stainless steel. An additional feature is the material’s high biocompatibility. It is the only form of bronze permitted for use in the food industry. Bronze, as used among other things for the Pilot’s Watch Automatic Spitfire (Ref. 326802), develops a singular patina with time, which makes every watch unique.</p>

                    <span>CERAMICS</span>
                    <div>
                        <p>Ceramics are lighter and harder than steel, absolutely scratch-resistant and have an agreeable, velvety surface. These properties make the high-tech material ideal for use in wristwatches.</p>
                        <p>Technical ceramics of the kind used in watches are based on polycrystalline powders such as silicates, aluminium oxide or silicon carbide. They are mixed with various additives to form a homogeneous mass, shaped and sintered at very high temperatures in an oven. During the sintering process, the additives vaporize to leave extremely stable ceramic bodies. The manufacture of a watch case, however, is very demanding because the ceramic shrinks by around a third during the baking process. This shrinkage has to be factored in as early as the design phase to ensure that the movement later fits snugly inside the case and satisfies the narrow tolerances. IWC presented the world’s first ceramic watch, the Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar (Ref. 3755), in 1986. Since then, the company has launched watch cases made of black boron carbide high-performance ceramic or brown silicon nitride ceramic. The latest example of innovative ceramics from Schaffhausen is the IWC Pilot’s Watches TOP GUN Collection. </p>
